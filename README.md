# Machine Learning - Image Classification

In the first part a machine learning pipeline has been applied in Python using the maternal health datasets to predict the womanâ€™s stage of risk of health in the future.  On the second part I have trained an existing Convolutional Neural Network model to identify images and classify them correctly.
